# Intro to Serverless Labs 
These labs walks you through the steps required to create, build, and run a Serverless application using IBM Cloud Functions. Serverless computing refers to a model where the existence of servers is entirely abstracted away. Even though servers exist, developers are relieved from the need to care about their operation. They are relieved from the need to worry about low-level infrastructural and operational details such as scalability, high-availability, infrastructure-security, and other details. Serverless computing is essentially about reducing maintenance efforts to allow developers to quickly focus on developing code that adds value.

Serverless computing simplifies developing cloud-native applications, especially microservice-oriented solutions that decompose complex applications into small and independent modules that can be easily exchanged. Some promising solutions like Apache OpenWhisk have recently emerged that ease development approaches used in the serverless model. IBM Cloud Functions is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform on IBM Cloud, built using the Apache OpenWhisk open source project, that allows you to execute code in response to an event.

It provides a serverless deployment and operations model. With a granular pricing model that works at any scale, you get exactly the resources you need – not more, not less – and you are charged for code that is really running.

**IBM Cloud Functions provides:**
• Support for multiple languages, including JavaScript, Python, Swift, and Java
• Support for running custom logic through Docker containers
• The ability to focus more on value-adding business logic, and less on low-level infrastructural and operational details.
• The ability to easily chain together microservices to form workflows via composition.
